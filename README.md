## Servo-motor-with-arduino
Increasing Efficiency of solar panels with Arduino Uno 

## Getting Started
# Items Required:

1. Arduino Uno Board Kit 
2. Male to Male Jumper Wires 
3. Resistors (10K) 
4. Light Detecting Resistors 
5. DC Servo Motor (SG90) 
6. Mini â€“ Solar Panel 
7. Solderless Bread Board 
8. Breadboard wires 
9. USB connecter 

# Setting up the circuit:
A link for the circuit diagram will be provided (in the future).

# Running the code:
Set up the Arduino IDE and execute the code and write it to the Arduino Board. If the connections are proper, the panel will turn towards the direction with maximum light intensity.
